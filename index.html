  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

  <p>I have created this website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose for doing this is to show the skills that I have learned during my process of learning how to code. This website was created during the beginning stages of my learning and will continually change as I learn new tricks that make coding easier. The contents of this site will display a multitude of things, including my reasons for learning, how I learned to code, why it interests me, and the issues that I have come across in my journey. </p>

  <h3>What Peaked My Interest?</h3>

  <p>I am not entirely sure what actually made me want to start coding or even think that it was something that I could do. During my undergrad, I took a basic Comtuter Science course as an elective. A few of the projects were based around writing a Javascript code, a C++ code and another that I do not remember. I found these to be very confusing and did not have a lot of guidance. Unfortunately, this turned me off to the idea of learning code.</p>

  <p>It wasnt until a couple years after I graduated that I hit a slump and didnt know what I wanted to do for a career. I started to research coding languages and wanted to learn something that I could play with. I discovered HTML. It started to make sense to me as I looked into it more. I spent a few years palying with some of it but didnt spend a lot of time learning. It wasnt until I got a job working for a company that wanted me to start learning a little JavaScript.</p>

  <p>The company knew that I did not know JS but they wanted me to learn basics to help my supervisor. I did not tell them I knew coding. There was a lot more to the job. After working there for a little over a year, I made a desicion to go back to school and get a Master's degree. It is at this point that I am starting this website.</p>

  <h3>My Plan of Action</h3>

  <p>I am utilizing a few websites to help learn to write HTML and CSS. I am also reading a few books to learn how to write JS. My course of action is as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Refine HTML skills</li>
    <li>Refine CSS skills and learn new methods</li>
    <li>Learn JS</li>
    <li>Continue to add new skills to website</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The referrences that I am using are not provided in any course that I am taking in my Graduate degree. They include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>www.freecodecamp.com</li>
    <li>www.codecademy.com</li>
    <li>www.w3school.com</li>
    <li>An assortment of books</li>
  </ul>
